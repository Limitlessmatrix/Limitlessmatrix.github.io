        <h2> Things I have done</h2> 
        <p id="projects"> I have been working on plenty of website projects lately. I worked with HTML tags and attributes. Learned about creating tables and linking to other pages. I am excited to be able to create mini games or animations including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>

        <h3> My favorite dishes</h3> 
        <p id="my_favorite-dishes"> I love cooking. It is like chemistry but with food. I've always enjoyed learning different recipes. I can follow directions pretty well but also have a natural chef's sight. Sometimes when I don't use recipes I just play the ingredients off sight. </p>
        <ul> Mashed potatoes and Roast </ul>
        <ul> Spagetti and Ground beef </ul>
        <ul> Mac and Cheese (extra cheesey) </ul>

        <h4> Why I am awesome</h4> 
        <p id="why-i-am-awesome"> I have been teaching myself programming for two years. I have not made too many projects cause just learning the basics about booleans, classes, keys, was hard. I know I still have so much to learn but I won't stop. I will try my best to code every day. I want to be able to work for myself and from anywhere in the planet. I want to visit Japan, China, Europe, and so much more. </p><br>
